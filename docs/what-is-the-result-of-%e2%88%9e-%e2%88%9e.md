# 什么是∞–∞？

> 原文:[https://www . geesforgeks . org/结果是什么-%e2%88%9e-%e2%88%9e/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-result-of-%e2%88%9e-%e2%88%9e/)

众所周知，从自身减去一个数会得到值 **0** ，但是有一个混淆，就是从**无穷大**减去**无穷大**是否为**零**。但事实并非如此。在因为**无穷大**不是一个 [**实** **数**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/real-numbers/) 。

**假设:**

*   First, assume that infinity minus infinity equals zero, that is, [T0】 ∞-∞= 0 【T1].
*   Now add the number 1 on both sides of the equation as **∩–∩+1 = 0+1** .
*   Is **∑+1 = ∑** and **0+1 = 1** , and then the two parts of the equation are simplified to **∑-∑ = 1** .

> 无穷减去无穷等于一和零是**不可能的**。使用这种类型的数学，将更容易得到无穷大减去无穷大等于任何实数。因此，从无穷大中减去无穷大就是**未定义**。

现在用我们著名的数学家(黎曼悖论)的概念，从∞中减去∞，得到一个精确的饼。

*   1-1/2+1/3-1/4+1/5-1/6+1/7-1/8+...+∞t1】。
*   Separate positive and negative terms from this series:
    *   **1+1/3+1/5+1/7+……**
    *   **-1/2–1/4–1/6–1/8–……**
*   Now, if you only add positive terms, you will get ∞, and if you add negative terms, you will get-∞.
*   **Riemann's** rearrangement theorem says that if there is a convergent series, its positive term adds up to ∞ and its negative term adds up to-∞, then it can rearrange the series into a series with any sum. Therefore, the same operation is performed for **π (π)** of this specific series.
*   The value of **π (π)** is positive (3.14359). Therefore, the first term of our new series will be 1, with a positive term until it approaches **π** . So we use **1/151** to add, making it **3.1471** .
*   Now users will use negative words to get just down.
*   So use -1/2\. Now **π** becomes **2.6471** , which is not exactly π.
*   Add some positive terms like this, add and subtract, and you will definitely get exactly π.
*   This is because at any stage of this process, the sum of the remaining positive terms is [T0】 ∩ 【T1], and the sum of the remaining negative terms is ∩. Therefore, no matter how low or high the user is, people can always be sure. We can accept enough conditions to reach an agreement.
*   So, **π = ∞–∞** That's why mathematicians decided to leave this undefined, because it doesn't exist, and it probably doesn't have any valuable meaning associated with it.
