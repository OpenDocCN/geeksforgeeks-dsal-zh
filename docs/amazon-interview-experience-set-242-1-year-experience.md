**Telephonic round: (1 hour)**It is started with interviewer introduction followed by my introduction. Need to write the code in shared docs. They shared CollabEdit link before interview.1) [Minimum Platforms](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-platforms/0)2) [Arrange given numbers to form the biggest number](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/largest-number-formed-from-an-array/0)After one week, they called me to Hyderabad office for on-site interview. They have arranged everything.Every round started with interviewer introduction followed by my introduction.End of every round, interviewer asked “Do you have any questions”?**Round-1: (1 hour, 2 interviewers)**1) Questions related to my exp, projects and my role, architecture of my projects2) can we construct a tree with single traversal? NO    which traversal is must needed ? INORDER. Why?Then he asked  [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/<wbr>construct-a-special-tree-from-<wbr>given-preorder-traversal/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/construct-a-special-tree-from-given-preorder-traversal/)2) [http://www.geeksforgeeks.<wbr>org/next-greater-element/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/next-greater-element/)**Round-2: (1 hour 45 min, 1 interviewer)**1) Multiplication of two numbers without using multiplication operator.2) He explained a situation like you have super market and items sold every day, blah blah… finally the question becomes as followsGiven a file which contains one product id per line(millions of products) which are sold and some product ids may repeat. We need to find how many items are unique in that file. (i.e sold uniquely)3) [Cycle in a LL](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-loop-in-linked-list/1)4) How we can implement a queue with one pointer5) [Given a key , search the key in the LL, if exists swap the values of prev node and current node. After I given solution then he asked me swap nodes NOT values.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/swap-kth-node-from-beginning-and-kth-node-from-end-in-a-singly-linked-list/1)6) [Given a binary tree, construct a MIRROR of that tree.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/mirror-tree/1)So many behavioural questions around 10 -15 questions. some areGive me an instance

*   和队友一起上课
*   当你分担队友的负担时
*   你的首相不同意你的意见
*   如果项目时间少了，你会怎么处理
*   你为提高团队效率做了什么
*   你在队里犯的大错
*   你被调到了新团队，但你对这项技术没有任何经验。你将如何处理？
*   你的队友工作不正常，因为你工作的时间更多。你将如何处理这种情况？
*   你想出了主意，但团队不同意
*   您希望改进哪些领域/技术？
*   等等，等等，如此之多

**Round-3: (1 hour, 2 interviewers)**They said that first we will go with technical questions then related to exp and projects.**1)** [Given an array find the missing numbers.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-number-in-array/0) Array is not sorted and range of elements also not known.Ex: input: a[]={1,100} output: 2,3,…99input a[]={100,1} output: 2,3,..99Then they asked algorithm for

*   如果只有一个数字丢失并且范围从 1 到 n
*   如果数组已排序且缺少一个数字

2) [Given a two nodes in a binary tree, check those are cousins or not.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-if-two-nodes-are-cousins/1) Cousins means both have to present in same level but doesn’t have a common parent.They wants within a single traversal of a tree we need to find. (2 traversal of a tree also not allowed. I have done in two traversal 🙂 )They given hints and finally we solved it.3) Related to heaps

*   如何插入一个值，时间复杂度是多少
*   如何删除一个值，时间复杂度是多少
*   如何用给定的数组构造堆，时间复杂度是多少

**Round-4: (1 hour, 1 interviwer)**He is senor most guy. I felt a little bit uncomfortable.1) Asked about current projects and my role and related to exp.2) He explained a scenario as follows:Amazon has so many products which are selling outside. Given a millions of products and he can tell how to construct a URL with product id to get the product details page which contains info about product, ratings and commnets, blah blah.Ex: if product id is 123456 then the URL becomes www.amazon.com/product/123456Then questions are as follows

*   检索该页面中出现的每个产品(例如:123456)的评级(例如:www.amazon.com/product/123456
*   找到每种产品(数百万种产品)的评级后。给出一个算法，找出排名前十的产品。要求我写生产级代码而不是伪代码。
*   然后他扩展了如果产品评级相同(某些产品可能会出现这种情况)，那么我们需要考虑评论数量更多的产品
*   上述情况的时间复杂性

3) Why you want to leave current job?**Suggestions:**1) **Need to cover (order is high to low priority):** Trees, Heaps, sorting and searching, LL, Stacks, Queues, strings, DP, Greedy, Divide and conquer, hash map and collisions, recursion and back tracking, bit manipulation, basic graph algorithms, OOD, scalability and memory units, any missing topics.2) You sholud know the time complexity for STL data structures.Ex: For hashing, we will say we can find a value in O(1) but if we are using C++ STL, map was implemented with Balanced BST so it will take O(logn).3) You **MUST** prepare some beheaviroual questions, atlest standard quesitons like Why Amazon? Why do you want to live?4) Practise on paper because you need to write on paper in all rounds of interview.
