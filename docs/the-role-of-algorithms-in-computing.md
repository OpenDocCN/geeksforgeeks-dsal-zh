**先决条件:** [算法简介](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-algorithms/)

*   The word [algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/) means "a process or a set of rules to be followed in calculation or other operations to solve problems". Therefore, the algorithm refers to a set of rules/instructions, which step by step define how to perform the work to obtain the expected results.
*   Algorithm is the core of most technologies used together with other technologies in contemporary computers *.*

***如何决定哪种算法最适合？***

**   It depends on how efficient the ***algorithm is when higher-order input is given.****   Possible ***restrictions/constraints*** on values.*   The architecture of computer and the types of storage devices to be used.*   Another important aspect is that the correctness of the algorithm implies that the algorithm is correct, if it produces correct output for each instance. Incorrect algorithms may not stop on some input instances at all, or give incorrect output.*

***算法的实际应用:***

*   ****Internet*** Without it, it is hard to imagine that the result of a day is *' s clever and efficient algorithm* With the help of these algorithms, various websites on the Internet can manage and operate a large amount of data. Find a good data transmission route, and use the search engine to find pages with specific information.*
**   Another great milestone is [Human Genome Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project) , which has made great progress towards the goal of identifying 100,000 genes in human DNA, determining the sequence of 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA, storing this huge amount of information *in the database, and developing data analysis tools. Each of these steps requires *a complex and efficient algorithm.***   Daily ***E-commerce*** activities rely heavily on our personal information, such as credit/debit card numbers, passwords, bank statements, OTP, etc. The core technologies used include public key [, cryptocurrency](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-a-cryptocurrency/) and digital signature based on digital algorithm [and number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory) .*   **[The method of linear programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linear-programming/)** is also such a technology, which is like
    *   It is widely used in *manufacturing* and other commercial enterprises that hardly need to allocate resources in the most favorable way.
    *   Or an organization may want to determine where to spend money to buy advertisements in order to *maximize* the opportunities for its organization to grow.*   **[Shortest path algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/)** is also widely used as
    *   In *transportation* companies, such as truck transportation or railway companies, there may be economic benefits in finding the shortest route through the road or railway network, because adopting the shortest route will reduce labor or fuel costs.
    *   Or a *routing node* on the Internet may need to find the shortest path through the network in order to quickly route messages.*   Even applications that don't need algorithm content at the application level rely heavily on algorithms, because applications rely on *hardware, GUI, network or object orientation* , all of which widely use algorithms.T65】*
