> 原文:[https://www . geeksforgeeks . org/随机化算法的重要性/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/importance-of-randomized-algorithms/)

**简介:**

*   [Randomization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/randomized-algorithms/) is an important concept, so randomization [algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/) is used in many fields, such as [number theory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/number-theory-competitive-programming/) [computational geometry](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/geometric-algorithms/) [graph theory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/) and distributed computing.
*   The input of randomization algorithm is similar to that of deterministic algorithm, and there are a series of random bits that can be used by the algorithm for random selection.
*   In other words, randomization algorithm is an algorithm whose behavior depends on input. Similar to deterministic algorithm, random selection is made as part of its logic.
*   As a result, even for the same input, the algorithm gives different outputs.
*   In other words, the algorithm is random; Therefore, its running time is usually explained by random variables.

**优势:**

*   Randomization algorithm is known for its simplicity.
*   Any deterministic algorithm can be easily transformed into a randomized algorithm. These algorithms are easy to understand and implement.
*   The randomization algorithm is very efficient.
*   Compared with any deterministic algorithm, they hardly occupy the execution time and space.
*   Compared with deterministic algorithm, randomization algorithm shows better asymptotic bounds.
*   In other words, the algorithm complexity of randomization algorithm is better than most deterministic algorithms.
*   Reliability is an important problem in many key applications, because not all randomization algorithms can give correct answers.
*   In addition, many randomization algorithms may not be terminated.
*   Therefore, reliability is an important issue to be dealt with.
*   The quality of randomization algorithm depends on the quality of random number generator as a part of the algorithm.
*   Unlike other design paradigms, randomization algorithm does not use a single design principle.
*   On the contrary, people should regard randomization algorithm as an algorithm designed using a set of principles.
*   On the contrary, people should regard randomization algorithm as an algorithm designed using a set of principles.

以下小节列出了一些设计原则:

**<u>证人概念</u> :**

*   这个原则涉及检查给定输入是否具有属性 X 的问题。
*   它是通过找到一个被称为证人或证书的特定对象来建立的。
*   证人被识别以证明输入确实具有期望的属性 x 的事实。
*   通过进行更少的试验，可以发现财产是否真的存在。
*   证人的在场是基于证人不在场的 X 财产的有力证明。这个原理用素性检验的例子来说明。

**<u>指纹</u> :**

*   By definition, fingerprints are short information representing larger objects.
*   Fingerprint identification is a technology to compare two large objects only by comparing their short fingerprints.
*   If the two fingerprints don't match, then objects A and B are different.
*   However, if the fingerprints match, there is strong circumstantial evidence that the two objects are the same.

**<u>检查恒等式</u> :**

*   Let's assume that an algebraic expression is given. The problem is to check whether the evaluation result of the expression is zero.
*   The principle of checking the identity is to plug the random variables of a given algebraic equation and check whether the evaluation result of the expression is zero.
*   If it is not zero, then the given expression is not an identity.
*   Otherwise, there is strong circumstantial evidence that the expression is identical with zero.

**<u>【随机采样和排序】</u> :**

*   The performance of the algorithm is sometimes improved by randomizing the input distribution or order.
*   It can be observed that for some sort of input, the performance of the algorithm can be higher or just acceptable.
*   Here, randomization leads to randomized ordering, division and sampling.
*   In addition, the randomization algorithm uses random samples to collect information about the input distribution. The recruitment problem illustrates this point.

**<u>挫败对手</u> :**

*   Randomization algorithm can be regarded as a game between a person and an opponent, that is, a game between the person who proposed the algorithm and the opponent who tried to defeat the algorithm by designing appropriate input, which made the algorithm take longer.
*   In other words, the randomization algorithm can be regarded as choosing an algorithm from a large group of deterministic algorithms, and this choice can be regarded as a scene where things become more difficult by giving random input, thus making tasks more difficult.
