[Dijkstra 算法](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/)是解决图中许多具有非负边权重的单源最短路径问题的最流行算法之一，即寻找图中两个顶点之间的最短距离。它是由计算机科学家 T2·埃德格·迪杰斯特拉在 1956 年构思的，三年后出版。

Dijkstra 的算法有几个真实世界的用例，其中一些如下:

1.  **Digital map service in Google Maps:** We have tried many times to find the distance in G-Maps, from one city to another, or from your location to the nearest desired location. There we met [the shortest path algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/printing-paths-dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm/) , because there are various routes/paths connecting them, but it must display the minimum distance, so Dykstra algorithm is used to find the minimum distance between two positions on the path. If India is regarded as a graph, with a vertex representing a city/place and the route between two cities/places as an edge, then by using this algorithm, the shortest route between any two cities/places or from one city/place to another city/place can be calculated.
2.  **Social networking application:** In many applications, you may have seen the application prompt a list of friends that specific users may know. How do you think many social media companies can efficiently realize this function, especially when the system has more than 1 billion users? The standard Dijkstra algorithm can be applied by using the shortest path measured by handshaking or connecting between users. When the social network graph is small, it uses the standard Dijkstra algorithm and some other features to find the shortest path. However, when the graph becomes larger and larger, the standard algorithm takes several seconds to count and uses alternative advanced algorithms.
3.  **Telephone network:** We know that in the telephone network, each line has a bandwidth,' b' The bandwidth of the transmission line is the highest frequency that the line can support. Generally speaking, if the signal frequency on a certain line is higher, the line will lower the signal frequency. Bandwidth indicates the amount of information that the line can transmit. If we imagine a city as a graph, the vertex represents the exchange station, the edge represents the transmission line, and the weight of the edge represents' B'. As you can see, it can belong to the category of the shortest distance problem, for which Dykstra method can be used.
4.  **Looking for IP route with open shortest path priority:** [Open shortest path priority (OSPF)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-shortest-path-first-ospf-protocol-states/) is a link-state [routing protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classes-of-routing-protocols/) , which is used to find the best path between source router and destination router with its own shortest path priority. Dijkstra algorithm is widely used in routing protocols needed by routers to update forwarding tables. The algorithm provides the shortest cost path from the source router to other routers in the network.
5.  **Flight schedule:** For example, if a person needs software to make flight schedule for customers. Agents can access the databases of all airports and flights. Besides the flight number, the airport of origin and the destination, the flight also has departure and arrival times. Specifically, given the departure airport and the start time, the agent wants to determine the earliest arrival time of the destination. This algorithm began to be used there.
6.  **Specify file server:** To specify file server in [local area network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/local-area-network-lan-technologies/) , Dijkstra's algorithm can be used. Consider that it takes an infinite amount of time to transfer files from one computer to another. Therefore, in order to minimize the "hop count" from the file server to every other computer on the network, our idea is to use Dijkstra algorithm to minimize the shortest path between networks, so as to achieve the minimum hop count.
7.  **Robot path:** Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles and robots have appeared, some of which are manual and some of which are automatic. Automated unmanned aircraft/robots for delivering packages to specific locations or tasks are loaded with this algorithm module, so that when the source and destination are known, the robot/unmanned aircraft moves in an orderly direction by following the shortest path to keep delivering packages in the shortest time.
