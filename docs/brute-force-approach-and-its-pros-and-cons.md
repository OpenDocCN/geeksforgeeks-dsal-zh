> 原文:[https://www . geesforgeks . org/蛮力进场及其利弊/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/brute-force-approach-and-its-pros-and-cons/)

在本文中，我们将讨论什么是蛮力[算法](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/most-important-type-of-algorithms/)以及它的**优点**和**缺点**。下面给出的是蛮力算法的一些特性:

*   This is an intuitive, direct and straightforward [problem solving technique](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-approach-a-coding-problem/) , which lists all possible methods or all possible solutions for a given problem.
*   Many problems in daily life are solved by brute force strategies, such as exploring all paths to nearby markets to find [the shortest path](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/) .
*   Make use of everything possible to optimize the shelf space, etc., and arrange books on the shelf.
*   In fact, brute force is used in daily life activities, even [optimization algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/optimization-techniques-set-1-modulus/) is ok.

**<u>强力算法的优点和 CONS</u>:**

**优点:**

*   Brute force method is a reliable method to find the correct solution by listing all possible candidate solutions to the problem.
*   This is a general method, not limited to any specific field.
*   Brute force is an ideal method to solve small and simple problems.
*   Known for its simplicity, it can be used as a benchmark.

**缺点:**

*   The brute force method is inefficient. For real-time problems, algorithm analysis often goes in ***o (n! )*** Growth order.
*   This method relies more on sacrificing the ability of computer system to solve problems than on good algorithm design.
*   Brute force algorithm is slow.
*   Compared with some other design examples, brute force algorithm is not constructive or creative.

**结论:**

蛮力算法是一种保证任何领域问题的解决方案的技术，有助于解决更简单的问题，并且还提供了一种解决方案，可以作为评估其他设计技术的基准，但是需要大量的运行时间并且效率低下。
